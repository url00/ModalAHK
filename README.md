# ModalAHK
Uses very simple state tracking to create mode-specific hotkeys.

## Dependencies
Requires a running instance of [Everything Search by voidtools](https://www.voidtools.com/) to leverage the built in device independent app launcher.

## How to use the default configuration

Hit `F1` to show the launcher. A menu will popup with options for modes.
To exit the current mode and return to the launcher hit `Ctrl-Alt-F1`.

You can also extend the system to make the modes auto switch based on the active window fairly straight forwardly.
